## Braking System

Utilizing PWM and PID control to regulate the movement of a car.

Pulse With Modulation consists of regulating the power transmitted to a component by altering between on and off states rapidly, making the apparent power an established fraction of the total power.

PID control means using the distance measured by an ultrasonic sensor, the current speed, and the traveled distance to determine what power must be delivered.

The target distance in the tests was 20.0 cm.
In the attached video, the travel time and the final distance were 1.31 s and 19.7 cm.
